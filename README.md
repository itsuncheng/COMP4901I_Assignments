# COMP4901I_Assignments

This repo contains the assignments I have completed for the COMP4901I Building Interactive Intelligent Systems course at HKUST. This course is essentially Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing and in fact, this course has been changed to this title following my year. 

`Assignment {no.} submission` directory contains the files/code I submitted while the `Building_Interactive_Intelligent_Systems_HW{no.}.pdf` is the problem sets for each assignment. Unfortunately, I could not find the instructions file for Assignment 3 but the code is still available.

* Twitter sentiment analysis using Logistic Regression
* Twitter sentiment analysis using CBOW embeddings and FeedForward Neural Network
* Amazon product review rating classifier using word-based CNN
